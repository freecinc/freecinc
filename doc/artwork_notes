Please create a clear and simple layout for me.
If you download all three files I attached to the same directory, then open index.html in your web browser you will see the content that is going into this web page.
Basically, it's a list of instructions for getting something up and running.The large blocks of shaded text they have to copy and save with a particular filename.
The smaller blocks of text are code that they must run in a terminal.This site doesn't need to be fancy, but it must be beautiful and clear.
If you have any questions, let me know.
