subject: Purchase of freesync.com

Hi Neil,

I found your name by looking up the whois for your site freesync.com. I am interested in purchasing  the domain freesync.com from you.

I've been building a free service that allows users to sync their TaskWarrior or Mirakel to-do lists with my server. It's the first free server in this genre, and will be a real boon to the communities that use it. But my domain name is not as good as yours.

Take a look at what I've built so far: https://freecinc.com

And let me know what you would charge for freesync.com
