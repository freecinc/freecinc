'''Taskserver''', also known as '''taskd''' or '''TaskWarrior-Server''',  is an open-source server daemon that allows users to sync their task data between multiple devices. While apps such as TaskWarrior provide convenient command-line access to editing a task list, in order to make that solution portable across devices there must be a way to sync tasks between two devices owned by the same user. Taskserver provides just such a solution.

When a client is configured for use with Taskserver, the Taskserver provides a public key pair which will later be used the client in order to authenticate itself. Any two clients (even when running on different platforms) that sync using this generated keypair will share a common set of tasks.


==Security==

Security is provided through public-key encryption, and knowledge of a shared key.


==Supported Clients==

Taskserver currently supports [[Taskwarrior]] 2.3.0 and the Android app Mirakel.


==History==

Development began in September 2012
