15:44 < jackdesert> Unode: Tell me which page of tw.org you want information about freecinc on, and I can submit a patch.
15:44 < Unode> jackdesert, the thing is we need a new section for it.
15:45 < Unode> jackdesert, just wanted to make sure we were not duplicating work
15:45 < jackdesert> Unode: By the way, is there any kind of a generator used for tw.org? It looks like each html page has a <html> element, <head>, and javascripts.
15:46 < jackdesert> Unode: No, I haven't written anything---I've just poked around inside to see what the project is like
15:46 < Unode> jackdesert, it's all manually coded, mostly by pbeckingham.
15:47 < Unode> We could have used a generator, but pbeckingham generally prefers to keep it simple and small on dependencies.
15:47 < Unode> It also makes it easier to accept patches.
15:47 < jackdesert> Unode: If you want to make a pass at adding a new section, I'm happy to edit/flush it out
15:49 < Unode> If you feel like it craft it based on the tools page (which is what I would do) and send the patch to pbeckingham. He's the last filter on what goes in the website.
15:52 < Unode> jackdesert, I'd also suggest you check what currently lives in tools and would fit the "Services" section. I can think of inthe.am as another candidate.

19:20 < pbeckingham> Unode: Does your statement "where conflicts may not be resolvable" conflict with your other statement "I don't know the exact details of the sync protocol"?
19:20 < pbeckingham> Unode: Or in other words, I'd like to hear about the scenarios you believe are conflicts.
19:21 < pbeckingham> Unode: SPOILER: There are no conflicts, that I know of.
19:22 < coddingtonbear> conflict free!  we've created a utopian task management society
19:22 < coddingtonbear> miru mir
19:22 < pbeckingham> coddingtonbear: merge-conflict free.  Sadly, not life-conflict free.
19:22 < coddingtonbear> I know, I know -- I just have a habit of making jokes nobody gets or can relate to :-)
19:25 < pbeckingham> jackdesert: tw.org is generated by vim and my fingers.  Don't worry about the structure - you're just providing a <tr>...</tr>
19:26 < pbeckingham> jackdesert: ... that will be pasted into tw.org/tools/index.html
