What do you think about changing the output of `task diagnostics` to use the full word "Certificate" instead of the shortened "Cert"?

Here's a snippet from `task diagnostics`:

{code}
CA: /home/vagrant/.task/freecinc_94eb3b8c.ca.pem (readable)
  Cert: /home/vagrant/.task/freecinc_94eb3b8c.cert.pem (readable)
Key: /home/vagrant/.task/freecinc_94eb3b8c.key.pem (readable)
  Ciphers: NORMAL
  Creds:
{code}

From reading this I was mistakenly typing the shortened form as I was setting up my configuration:

{code}
# doesn't work
task config taskd.cert ~/.task/freecinc_94eb3b8c.cert.pem

# works
task config taskd.certificate ~/.task/freecinc_94eb3b8c.cert.pem
{code}

Like I said, not a bug per se, but I thought it was indeed a bug because the configuration parameter name did not match the output of `task diagnostics`
