How I Got Into This
===================

I wanted a way to munge down my non-fun things in life. Getting a dentist appointment, buying tickets to a musical I wanted to see. But I did not want to just write them down and forget them, or write them down and lose the paper, or write them in my computer and then end up on a different computer at work, or write them in my phone and not have access to them on my computer at all.

So when I went looking for task management lists, I was thrilled to find that there was one called `apt-get install task`.

So I made my first list of 10 things or so in TaskWarrior, but suddenly that was not good enough. I needed to be able to sync the tasks between my two laptops. (One stays at work, one stays at home.) So I stopped using TaskWarrior entirely until I was able to work through getting a sync server set up (no small feat).

After a four day hiatus from using TaskWarrior while I set up my sync server, I went back to happily adding and organizing tasks from the command line. Until that was not enough anymore either. My four days setting up a sync server was mostly for naught if other people could not build upon it and use it to. (What else is my server going to do but wait for me to sync?)

So once again, I put TaskWarrior aside and spent about ten days sneaking in odd hours, designing in my head, interaction design mostly, whittling down to what I thought was an MVP. Building it as a Rack app. Firing it up (ugly as it was), and finding that copy-and-pasting certificates from a web page was unreliable! Thwarted, but not for long. I pulled through and finally today did my first sync with an auto-generated cert.

So in a couple more weeks it will be ready for the world: FreeCinc.
