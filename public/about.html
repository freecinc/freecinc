	<h1>About FreeCinc</h1>

	<h2> History</h2>
	<p> FreeCinc was launched on July 2, 2014 in order to make it easier for those using TaskWarrior to be able to sync their tasks with a central server without having to manage and host their own Taskserver. 
	</p>

	<h2> Is it Really Free?</h2>

	<p> FreeCinc is a free service. Anyone can generate a keypair and sync their tasks at no charge. 
	</p>

	<h2> Are my tasks secure?</h2>
	<p> Your tasks are fairly secure with us. Improvements are currently being made in the Taskserver software to provide better isolation between users, and as newer releases of Taskserver come out, our security will only get better. If for some reason you have great reason to need completely secure solution for task syncing (maybe you are running for president or something), you are welcome to set up and host your own taskserver. 
	</p>
	 
	<h2> How do I sync between two different devices?</h2>

	<p> In order to sync between two different devices (a work laptop and a home laptop, for instance), you need to configure your client the same on both laptops. The way to do this is to visit the '/generate' page, and configure your first laptop from it. Then save a copy of the '/generate' page and open the saved web page from your second laptop. Use the saved web page to configure your second laptop.
	</p>

	<h2> Troubleshooting </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Check your Taskwarrior version. 2.3.0 or greater is supported.</li>
		<li>Run `task diagnostics`. Verify that all three keys that you downloaded from freecinc show up as 'readable'. </li>
		<li>Try running the configuration steps again, either from the '/generate' page that you saved for later, or visit the '/generate' page again, download new keys, and configure from scratch. </li>
		<li>If running TaskWarrior, one way to completely wipe out your configuration is to simply remove the ~/.taskrc file. This does not remove your tasks, just wipes out your configuration. The next time you run TaskWarrior you will be asked if you would like to generate a fresh config.</li>

	</ul>
